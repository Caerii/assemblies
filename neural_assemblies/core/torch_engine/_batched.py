"""Batched projection through a shared connectome (Phase 2, Lever B).

See docs/gpu_scale_design.md. The single-area sparse loop is CPU-favorable
because each projection is sub-millisecond of work; the GPU win comes from
running MANY independent projections at once so the fixed per-round overhead
(kernel launches, selection) is amortized across the batch.

This module implements the cleanest batching case: ``B`` independent activity
states projected through ONE shared connectome (batch inference / parse -- e.g.
classifying or parsing B inputs in parallel through a trained brain). Because
the connectome is shared there is no ragged-materialization problem: the drive
is a single ``[B, n]`` tensor, computed by one batched sparse-dense matmul, and
selection is one ``torch.topk(dim=1)`` over the batch.

Measured (RTX 3080, n=50k, k=224): identical results to sequential per item, and
7x (B=8) / 21x (B=32) faster; efficiency peaks near B=32 before the batched SpMM
saturates memory bandwidth.

Batching across INDEPENDENT connectomes (data-parallel training of different
brains) is Phase 3 -- it needs a block-diagonal CSR and is scoped separately.
