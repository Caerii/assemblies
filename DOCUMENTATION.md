## Introduction

### Neural Assemblies and the Assembly Calculus

Neural assemblies are groups of neurons that fire together and represent specific concepts or cognitive functions. According to the Assembly Calculus proposed by Papadimitriou et al., these assemblies can perform complex computations through operations like projection, association, and merge.

The Assembly Calculus provides a computational framework that models how assemblies of neurons can carry out computations. It introduces operations that manipulate these assemblies, allowing for the representation and processing of hierarchical structures, such as those found in language syntax.

Key concepts from the Assembly Calculus:

- **Projection**: Creating a new assembly in a downstream area that represents a copy of an existing assembly.
- **Association**: Increasing the overlap between two assemblies to represent an association between their respective concepts.
- **Merge**: Combining two assemblies to form a new assembly that represents the combination of their respective concepts.

### The NEMO Model

The NEMO (NEuronal MOdels) model, introduced by Mitropolsky et al., extends the Assembly Calculus by providing a biologically plausible model of neural computation. It incorporates additional biological realism, including:

- **Distinct Neuron Types**: Modeling excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
- **Plasticity Mechanisms**: Implementing Hebbian plasticity and synaptic weight adjustments.
- **Brain Areas and Connectivity**: Simulating multiple brain areas with specific connectivity patterns.

The NEMO model aims to bridge the gap between neural activity and cognitive functions, providing a framework to simulate complex tasks like language acquisition and processing.

## Simulation Details

### Implementing the Assembly Calculus

The project implements the operations of the Assembly Calculus within the `brain.py` and `brain_util.py` modules. These operations include:

- **Projection**: Implemented in the `project` method of the `Brain` class, where an assembly projects to a downstream area, forming a new assembly.
- **Association**: Implemented in the `associate` method (if present), where two assemblies increase their overlap through simultaneous activation.
- **Merge**: Implemented in the `merge` method (if present), combining two assemblies to form a new one with connections to both parent assemblies.

The simulations validate the mathematical predictions of the Assembly Calculus, such as the convergence of assemblies during projection and the preservation of overlaps.

### Parser Simulation

The `parser.py` script simulates a parser based on neural assemblies, demonstrating how assemblies can represent and process language structures.

#### Key Components

- **Brain Areas**: Represent different linguistic components, such as `LEX` (lexicon), `SUBJ` (subject), `VERB`, and `OBJ` (object).
- **Assemblies**: Groups of neurons representing specific words or grammatical structures.
- **Operations**: Utilize projection and association to simulate the activation and interaction of assemblies.
- **Rules**: Define how assemblies interact based on grammatical structures, implemented through `AreaRule` and `FiberRule` classes.

#### How It Works

1. **Word Activation**: As each word in a sentence is read, its corresponding assembly in the lexicon (`LEX`) is activated in the `PHON` (phonological) area.

2. **Rule Application**: Predefined rules determine how this activation projects to other brain areas, simulating grammatical processing. For example, a noun projects from `PHON` to `LEX_NOUN` and then to `SUBJ` or `OBJ` based on its role.

3. **Projection**: Assemblies project to other areas, forming new assemblies that represent higher-level structures, such as phrases or sentences.

4. **Readout**: After processing, the assemblies can be read out to reconstruct the parsed sentence or to extract grammatical relationships.

#### Relation to Language Acquisition

By simulating how assemblies form and interact during language processing, the project models early stages of language acquisition as described in "The Architecture of a Biologically Plausible Language Organ". It demonstrates how neural circuits can learn representations of nouns and verbs from grounded input without explicit supervision.

### Turing Machine Simulation

The `turing_sim.py` script explores how neural assemblies can simulate Turing machine concepts, investigating the computational limits of the neural model.

#### Key Concepts

- **Sequence Formation**: Simulating the storage and retrieval of sequences, analogous to the tape of a Turing machine.
- **State Transitions**: Modeling state changes using assemblies, where each state is represented by an assembly, and transitions are simulated through projections.
- **Computational Power**: Demonstrating that the enhanced NEMO model can perform arbitrary computations, supporting the claims in the papers about the model's computational capabilities.
