Assembly Calculus operations.

This module implements the core operations of the Assembly Calculus:
- Projection: Creating new assemblies in downstream areas
- Association: Increasing overlap between assemblies
- Merge: Combining assemblies to form new ones
- Overlap: Preserving and computing overlaps

Based on:
Papadimitriou et al. "Brain Computation by Assemblies of Neurons" (2020)
