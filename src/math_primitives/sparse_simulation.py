# sparse_simulation.py

"""
Sparse simulation engine for neural assembly dynamics.

This module contains the complex sparse simulation algorithms extracted
from the root brain.py projection logic, including dynamic connectome expansion,
first-time winner tracking, and input distribution management.

Biological Context:
- Implements sparse simulation of neural assemblies
- Manages dynamic expansion of connectomes when new neurons fire
- Handles input distribution from multiple brain areas and stimuli
- Maintains synaptic connectivity patterns for learning

Assembly Calculus Context:
- Enables efficient simulation of large-scale neural networks
- Supports dynamic assembly formation and connectivity
- Models synaptic plasticity in sparse neural populations

Mathematical Foundation:
- Connectome expansion: Dynamic matrix resizing with padding
- Input distribution: Multinomial sampling across input sources
- Winner indexing: First-time vs repeat winner tracking
- Synaptic assignment: Bernoulli sampling for connectivity
