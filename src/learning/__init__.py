"""
Learning and adaptation mechanisms.

Intended to implement various learning algorithms and adaptation
mechanisms for neural assemblies, including Hebbian learning and
memory consolidation.

Currently implemented in:
- src.compute.plasticity (PlasticityEngine, Hebbian rules)
- src.core.numpy_engine (plasticity application in projection)
- src.core.cuda_engine (CUDA Hebbian update kernel)
