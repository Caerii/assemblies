CUDA Kernels for Assembly Calculus
==================================

Custom CuPy/CUDA kernels for GPU-accelerated assembly operations.

Modules:
- implicit: Hash-based implicit connectivity kernels (no weight matrix storage)
- batched: 2D-grid batched projection kernels for multi-area parallelism
- v2: Alternative kernel implementations and benchmarks
