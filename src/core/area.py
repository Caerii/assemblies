Neural Area Simulation

This module implements the Area class for simulating individual brain areas
within the neural assembly framework. Each area represents a distinct brain
region with its own neural population and assembly dynamics.

Biological Context:
- Models cortical columns, brain regions, or functional areas
- Implements sparse neural coding: only k neurons fire per timestep
- Tracks neural activity patterns and assembly formation
- Supports both explicit (full simulation) and sparse (statistical) modes

Assembly Calculus Context:
- Each area can contain multiple neural assemblies
- Assemblies are sets of k co-active neurons representing concepts
- Assembly formation follows winner-take-all competition
- Supports assembly fixation for stable representations

Mathematical Foundation:
- Sparse coding: k/n ratio determines representation sparsity
- Winner-take-all: Only top-k neurons with highest inputs fire
- Hebbian plasticity: Synaptic weights strengthen with co-activation
- Statistical efficiency: Sparse simulation for large populations

    Neural Area for Assembly Simulation
    
    Represents a brain area containing a population of neurons that can form
    neural assemblies through co-activation and learning. Each area implements
    sparse neural coding where only a small fraction of neurons fire per timestep.
    
    This class models the fundamental unit of neural computation in the Assembly
    Calculus framework, where assemblies of co-active neurons represent concepts
    and perform computations through their interactions.
    
    Biological Principles:
    - Sparse coding: Only k neurons fire per timestep (k << n)
    - Assembly formation: Co-active neurons form stable assemblies
    - Plasticity: Synaptic weights adapt through Hebbian learning
    - Hierarchical processing: Areas can project to other areas
    
    Assembly Calculus Operations:
    - Assembly creation: Winner-take-all selection forms new assemblies
    - Assembly fixation: Stable assemblies can be frozen for reuse
    - Assembly projection: Assemblies can project to other areas
    - Assembly association: Assemblies can become more similar through co-activation
