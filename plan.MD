We will be extending the model to images, and then afterwards trying to bridge visual and linguistic representations and learn from them as input.

# Visual Input Representation: 

Images need to be converted into a format that can be processed by neuronal assemblies. This typically involves feature extraction and encoding visual patterns into neuronal activity.

# Visual Brain Areas: 

Introduce new brain areas (e.g., VISUAL_CORTEX, OBJECT_RECOGNITION, SCENE_ANALYSIS) to handle image processing.

# Integrating Image Processing into the Model:

Feature Extraction: Use image processing techniques to extract features from images (edges, textures, shapes).
Assembly Activation: Map these features to neuronal assemblies in the visual areas.
Combining Modalities: Create connections between visual assemblies and linguistic assemblies to enable multimodal parsing.
