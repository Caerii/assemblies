# üî¨ Scientific Critique and Reframed Research Strategy

## **CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF PROPOSED PAPERS**

### **‚ùå MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH CURRENT APPROACH**

#### **1. Fundamental Theoretical Gaps**
- **Oversimplified Assembly Calculus**: Current framing treats Assembly Calculus as a computational trick rather than a fundamental theory of neural computation
- **Missing Complex Systems Framework**: No consideration of emergence, criticality, or phase transitions
- **Weak Biological Foundation**: "Input voltage as external stimulation" is a computational convenience, not a biological insight
- **Scale Mismatch**: Jumping to 86B neurons without understanding principles at smaller scales

#### **2. Methodological Weaknesses**
- **Engineering Focus**: Optimizing GPU memory is not science - it's engineering
- **Missing Validation**: No experimental validation against real neural data
- **Circular Reasoning**: Using Assembly Calculus to validate Assembly Calculus
- **Computational Bias**: Confusing computational efficiency with biological relevance

#### **3. Scientific Rigor Issues**
- **Premature Claims**: Claiming "human brain simulation" without validating basic neural properties
- **Missing Controls**: No comparison with established models (e.g., spiking neural networks)
- **Unfalsifiable Hypotheses**: Many claims cannot be experimentally tested
- **Publication Strategy Over Science**: Focusing on journal impact rather than scientific contribution
