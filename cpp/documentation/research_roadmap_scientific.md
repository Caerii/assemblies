# 🔬 Scientific Research Roadmap: Sparse Neural Assemblies as Emergent Computational Primitives

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

We need to fundamentally reframe this research from "GPU optimization for big simulations" to "understanding the complex systems principles of neural computation." The real scientific question is: **How do sparse, noisy neural networks give rise to stable, reliable computation?**

## **🧠 CORE SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS**

### **Central Hypothesis:**
**Biological neural networks operate near a critical point where sparse, stochastic activity self-organizes into stable computational assemblies that solve the binding problem and enable robust information processing.**

### **Testable Predictions:**
1. **Critical Sparsity**: There exists a critical sparsity level (~0.01-0.1%) where assemblies transition from unstable to stable
2. **Scaling Laws**: Assembly stability follows power-law scaling with network size
3. **Information Optimality**: Sparse assembly coding is near-optimal for biological energy/information trade-offs
4. **Universal Dynamics**: Assembly formation follows universal critical phenomena across brain regions
