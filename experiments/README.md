# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experimental investigations and research conducted with the assembly calculus framework.

## Structure

- `hyperdimensional_assemblies/` - Investigation of Assembly Calculus + Hyperdimensional Computing integration

## Hyperdimensional Assemblies Investigation

The main investigation file is `assembly_hdc_investigation.py`, which provides a comprehensive, literate programming approach to understanding the intersection between Neural Assembly Theory and Hyperdimensional Computing.

### Key Features

- **Literate Programming**: Each section builds intuition step by step
- **Evidence-Based**: All claims backed by rigorous testing
- **Comprehensive**: Covers all major aspects of the integration
- **Educational**: Explains both theory and implementation

### Usage

```bash
python experiments/hyperdimensional_assemblies/assembly_hdc_investigation.py
```

### What You'll Learn

1. How to integrate neural assemblies with HDC operations
