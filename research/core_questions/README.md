# Core Research Questions

This directory contains the **fundamental scientific questions** driving this research. Each question gets its own subdirectory with a complete investigation.

## Philosophy

**Start with questions, not papers.** Papers emerge naturally when questions are answered with validated evidence.

## Question Template

Each research question should have:

```
QXX_question_name/
├── hypothesis.md              # What exactly are we claiming?
├── theoretical_basis.md       # Mathematical/theoretical foundation
├── experiments.md             # How do we test this?
├── results.md                 # What have we found?
├── analysis.md                # Interpretation of results
└── conclusions.md             # What can we claim?
```

## Active Questions

*To be populated with your research questions*

### Example Structure:

- **Q01: Assembly Stability** - Do sparse assemblies converge to stable attractors?
- **Q02: Critical Phenomena** - Are there phase transitions in assembly formation?
- **Q03: Scaling Laws** - How do assembly properties scale with network size?
- **Q04: Information Capacity** - What is the information-theoretic capacity?
- **Q05: Biological Validation** - Do real brains exhibit these dynamics?

## Creating a New Question

1. Create directory: `QXX_descriptive_name/`
2. Copy `_question_template/` contents
3. Fill out `hypothesis.md` first
4. Design experiments to test hypothesis
5. Run experiments and document results
6. Draw conclusions from evidence

## Status Tracking

### Not Started
*Questions identified but not yet investigated*

### In Progress
*Questions under active investigation*

### Completed
*Questions with validated conclusions*

### Abandoned
*Questions that didn't pan out (document why!)*

**Remember: Good questions are more valuable than quick answers.**
