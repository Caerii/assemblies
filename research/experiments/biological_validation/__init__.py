"""
Biological Validation Experiments

Compares simulation results with real neural data:
- Sparsity comparison: Do simulated sparsity levels match biology?
- Firing rate analysis: Do simulated firing patterns match recordings?
- Assembly detection: Can we find assembly-like structures in real data?
- Timescale validation: Do dynamics match biological timescales?
