Information Theory Experiments

Analyzes the information-theoretic properties of assembly coding:
- Coding capacity: How much information can assemblies encode?
- Coding efficiency: Bits per neuron
- Error correction: Noise tolerance from information theory perspective
- Compression: Assembly vs dense coding comparison
