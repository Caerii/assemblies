## Background

### Neural Assemblies and the Assembly Calculus

Neural assemblies are groups of neurons that fire together, representing specific concepts or cognitive functions. The **Assembly Calculus** proposed by Papadimitriou et al. provides a computational framework modeling how these assemblies perform complex computations through operations like projection, association, and merge.

**Key concepts:**

- **Projection**: Creating a new assembly in a downstream area that represents a copy of an existing assembly.
- **Association**: Increasing the overlap between two assemblies to represent an association between their respective concepts.
- **Merge**: Combining two assemblies to form a new assembly representing the combination of their respective concepts.

### The NEMO Model

The **NEMO (NEuronal MOdels)** model, introduced by Mitropolsky et al., enhances the Assembly Calculus by incorporating additional biological realism:

- **Distinct Neuron Types**: Modeling excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
- **Plasticity Mechanisms**: Implementing Hebbian plasticity and synaptic weight adjustments.
- **Brain Areas and Connectivity**: Simulating multiple brain areas with specific connectivity patterns.

## Project Modules

### Brain Simulation (`brain.py`)

Provides classes for simulating brain areas and their interactions:

- **`Area`**: Represents a brain area containing neurons.
- **`Brain`**: Manages multiple areas and stimuli, handling neural activity and synaptic plasticity.

**Usage Example**:

```python
from brain import Brain

# Initialize the brain
brain_model = Brain(p=0.05)

# Add areas
brain_model.add_area('VisualCortex', n=1000, k=100, beta=0.05)

# Simulate projections
brain_model.project(
    areas_by_stim={'visual_stimulus': ['VisualCortex']},
    dst_areas_by_src_area={'VisualCortex': ['AuditoryCortex']}
)
```

### Brain Utilities (`brain_util.py`)

Utility functions for simulations:

- **Saving/Loading Models**: `sim_save`, `sim_load`
- **Computing Overlaps**: `overlap`, `get_overlaps`

**Usage Example**:

```python
import brain_util as bu

# Save the brain model
bu.sim_save('brain_model.pkl', brain_model)

# Compute overlap between assemblies
overlap_count = bu.overlap(assembly_a, assembly_b)
```

### Learning Experiments (`learner.py`)

Implements learning experiments:

- **Word Acquisition**: Simulates learning of nouns and verbs from grounded input.
- **Syntax Learning**: Demonstrates how syntax and word order can be learned.

**Usage Example**:

```python
from learner import LearnBrain

# Initialize the brain
brain = LearnBrain(p=0.05, LEX_k=100)

# Train with simple sentences
brain.train_simple(30)

# Test word retrieval
retrieved_word = brain.testIndexedWord(PHON_INDICES["RUN"])
print(f"Retrieved word: {retrieved_word}")
```

### Overlap Simulations (`overlap_sim.py`)

Simulations examining overlap preservation:

**Usage Example**:

```python
import overlap_sim

assembly_overlap, proj_overlap = overlap_sim.overlap_sim()
print(f"Assembly Overlap: {assembly_overlap}")
```

### Parser Simulation (`parser.py`)

Contains code for parsing sentences using the brain simulation framework:

- **Languages Supported**: English and Russian
- **Grammar Rules**: Simulates parsing using predefined grammar rules.

**Usage Example**:

```python
from parser import parse

# Parse an English sentence
parse("cats chase mice", language="English")

# Parse a Russian sentence
parse("kot vidit sobaku", language="Russian")
```
